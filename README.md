## For the project to work correctly:

After cloning the project to your device, make sure that the database you need is set in 
the [settings.py](https://github.com/DaryaKhatsuk/Online-store/blob/master/graduarion_project/graduarion_project/settings.py) 
file, in *DATABASES*, the database you need is installed.

In the [parser_for_bases.py](https://github.com/DaryaKhatsuk/Online-store/blob/master/graduarion_project/site1/management/commands/parser_for_bases.py) 
file, change the *path to the plorts.txt* file to match the path on your device and run the file through *the terminal* of the python interpreter.
